/**
 * CONDITIONLISTS are used to build advanced logical statement. At the core, a CONDITIONLIST allows various ways of comparing multiple CONDITION using "and" or "or".
 * A basic logical statement (x AND y) should be extensible in two ways: first, by concatenating (x AND y OR z) and second, by nesting (x AND (y OR z)).
 * CONDITIONLIST structures are able to accomplish both of these functionalities.
 * 
 * A CONDITIONLIST contains one Object "con", which can be either a CONDITION or another CONDITIONLIST. It also contains a logical operator and a link to another CONDITIONLIST "nextCon" (separate from the aforementioned CONDITIONLIST/CONDITION object)
 * Using this structure, we can create a simple logical comparison, and then concatinate or nest.
 * 
 * One CONDITION can be represented by setting the con Object to that condition. A logical comparison may be made by setting a logical operator, creating a new CONDITIONLIST and linking it to nextCon.
 * Concatination may be achieved indefinitely by continuing to string CONDITIONLISTs together, like in a linked list.
 * 
 * We may nest at any time by linking "con" to a CONDITIONLIST instead of a CONDITION.
 * 
 * In this way, logical statements of any complexity may be represented and executed.
 * 
 * We are able to entirely remove ambiguity by wrapping every CONDITION and nested CONDITIONLISTS in brackets ([ ])
